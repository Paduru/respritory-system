        <p class="reading_text">
          The respiratory system is the organ system that allows you to breathe.
          It can serve many different functions like giving you the ability to
          speak and smell. It can also warm and moisturize the air in your body
          to fit your body needs. The respiratory system delivers oxygen to the
          cells in your body, removes waste gases like carbon dioxide from your
          body, and protects your airways.
          <br />
          The respiratory system has many components as well. It operates by
          pulling in air from your mouth and nose, regulating the temperature
          and humidity air with your sinuses, and delivers it to the lungs using
          the pharynx, trachea, and bronchial tubes. Inside the lungs, the
          oxygen is removed from the air with the help of alveolus, bronchioles,
          capillaries. Then, the bloodstream takes it to all your organs and
          tissues. The lung pulls in and pushes out air with the help of the
          diaphragm.
          <br />
          <br />
          Components of the Respiratory System:
        </p>
        <ul class="reading_text">
          <li>Mouth and nose: Openings that pull in air</li>
          <li>
            Sinuses: Hollow areas between the bones in your head that regulate
            the temperature and humidity of the air
          </li>
          <li>
            Pharynx (throat): Tube that delivers air from your mouth and nose to
            the trachea
          </li>
          <li>Trachea (windpipe).: Passage connecting your throat and lungs</li>
          <li>
            Bronchial tubes: Tubes at the bottom of your windpipe that connect
            into each lung
          </li>
          <li>
            Lungs: Two organs that remove oxygen from the air and pass it into
            your blood
          </li>
          <li>
            Diaphragm: Muscle that helps your lungs pull in air and push it out
          </li>
          <li>Ribs: Bones that surround and protect your lungs and heart</li>
          <li>
            Alveoli: Tiny air sacs in the lungs. Oxygen and carbon dioxide takes
            place
          </li>
          <li>
            Bronchioles: Small branches of the bronchial tubes that lead to the
            alveoli
          </li>
          <li>
            Capillaries: Blood vessels in the alveoli walls that move oxygen and
            carbon dioxide
          </li>
          <li>
            Lung lobes: Sections of the lungs, there are three in the right lung
            and two in the left
          </li>
          <li>
            Pleura: Thin sacs that surround each lung lobe and separate your
            lungs from the chest wall
          </li>
        </ul>
