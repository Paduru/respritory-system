        At our learning center, you can find a visual aid. This a is a visual
        representation of the respiratory system with all the components labeled
        and explained. There is also a disease phamphlet which explains the
        effects of the disease, cystic fibrosis, on the respiratory system. You
        can also play a game. There will be a piece of paper with the
        instructions on it. There will a disection video showing you how we
        disected a fetal pig and removed some of the respiratory organs. There
        will also be a box containing the pig's lungs (and heart), trachea, and
        nostrils. Lastly, there will be images of human lung cells underneath a
        microscope. The work cited page show all the sources we used cited APA
        format.
